    riskType - could be slashing, smart contract, protocol
    poolName
    apy
    minPeriod,
    leverage
    investmentarm,
    adt - the asset deposit type could be a native deposits or ERC 20 deposits
    asset - the address of the asset if it is an ERC 20 deposit type
```

### getPool: 
Takes the `id` of the pool and returns a `Pool`:
```
struct Pool {
    uint256 id;
    string poolName;
    CoverLib.RiskType riskType;
    uint256 apy;
    uint256 minPeriod;

    uint256 coverTvl;
    uint256 tcp;
    bool isActive;
    uint256 percentageSplitBalance;
    uint256 investmentArmPercent;
    uint8 leverage;
    address asset;
    CoverLib.AssetDepositType assetType;
}
```

### getAllPools: 
Returns an array of `Pool`

### getPoolCovers:
Gets the covers associated with a specific pool. Takes the pool `id` and returns an array of `Cover`:
```
struct Cover {
    uint256 id;
    string coverName;
    RiskType riskType;
    string chains;
    uint256 capacity;
    uint256 cost;
    uint256 capacityAmount;
    uint256 coverValues;
    uint256 maxAmount;
    uint256 poolId;
    string CID;
}
```

### getPoolsByAddress
Gets the pools for a users by taking the `user address` and returns an an array of the user `PoolInfo`:
```
struct PoolInfo {
    string poolName;
    uint256 poolId;
    uint256 dailyPayout;
    uint256 depositAmount;
    uint256 apy;
    uint256 minPeriod;
    uint256 tvl;
    uint256 tcp; // Total claim paid to users
    bool isActive; // Pool status to handle soft deletion
    uint256 accruedPayout;
}
```

### poolWithdraw:
Called by users to withdraw their funds deposited into a pool. Takes the `poolid` as parameter

### vaultWithdraw:
Called by users to withdraw their funds deposited into a vault. Takes the `vaultid` as parameter

### deposit
Called by users to deposit funds into a pool. Takes a `DepositParam` as parameter:
```
struct DepositParams {
    address depositor;
    uint256 poolId;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 period;
    CoverLib.DepositType pdt - pool deposit type, could be pool a pool deposit or a vault depost. Would be a pool deposit in this cases
    CoverLib.AssetDepositType adt - the asset deposit type could be a native deposits or ERC 20 deposits
    address asset - the address of the asset if it is an ERC 20 deposit type
}
```

### claimProposalFunds
Called by users to claim their funds from an approved proposal. Takes the `proposalid` as parameter

### getUserDeposit
Gets the deposit for a users into a pool by taking the `poolid` and the `user address` and return the user `Deposit`
```
struct Deposits {
    address lp;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 poolId;
    uint256 dailyPayout;
    CoverLib.Status status;
    uint256 daysLeft;
    uint256 startDate;
    uint256 expiryDate;
    uint256 accruedPayout;
    CoverLib.DepositType pdt; // Vault deposit or normal pool deposit?
}
```

# Vaults
### createVault
```
    vaultname 
    poolIds - the ids of the pools that would be added to the vault
    poolPercentageSplit -  the percentage split of the pools. Must be the same number with the pools and the sum must be = 100
    minIv - vault min investment accepted
    maxIv - vault max investment accepted
    minPeriod - vault min period accepted
    adt - the asset deposit type could be a native deposits or ERC 20 deposits
    asset - the address of the asset if it is an ERC 20 deposit type
```

### vaultDeposit
Called by users to deposit funds into a vault. Takes the `vaultId`, the `period` for deposit and the `amount`. It is also a `payable` function, so if the `adt` is native the `amount` would be `0` and the `msg.value` would be used, if otherwise the `amount` must be more than 0 and the vault's `asset` is accepted as deposit for the user.

### getVault
Takes the `id` of the vault and returns a `Vault`:
```
struct Vault {
    uint256 id;
    string vaultName;
    CoverLib.Pool[] pools;
    uint256 minInv;
    uint256 maxInv;
    uint256 minPeriod;
    CoverLib.AssetDepositType assetType;
    address asset;
}
```

### getVaultPools
Gets the pools associated with a specific vault. Takes the `vaultid` and returns an array of `Pool`:
```
struct Pool {
    uint256 id;
    string poolName;
    CoverLib.RiskType riskType;
    uint256 apy;
    uint256 minPeriod;
    uint256 tvl;
    uint256 baseValue;
    uint256 coverTvl;
    uint256 tcp;
    bool isActive;
    uint256 percentageSplitBalance;
    uint256 investmentArmPercent;
    uint8 leverage;
    address asset;
    CoverLib.AssetDepositType assetType;
}
```

### getUserVaultPoolDeposits
Gets the users individual pool deposits in a vault taking the `vaultid` and the `user address` and return an array of the user individual `Deposit`
```
struct Deposits {
    address lp;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 poolId;
    uint256 dailyPayout;
    CoverLib.Status status;
    uint256 daysLeft;
    uint256 startDate;
    uint256 expiryDate;
    uint256 accruedPayout;
    CoverLib.DepositType pdt; // Vault deposit or normal pool deposit?
}
```

### getUserVaultPoolDeposit
Gets the users vault deposit by taking the `vaultid` and the `user address` and returning the user `VaultDeposit`
```
struct VaultDeposit {
    address lp;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 vaultId;
    uint256 dailyPayout;
    CoverLib.Status status;
    uint256 daysLeft;
    uint256 startDate;
    uint256 expiryDate;
    uint256 accruedPayout;
}
```
